Act as a Senior UI/UX Designer and Frontend Engineer. Create a high-fidelity, responsive landing page for a productivity application called "Pules" (a study tracking app for students).

**Design Aesthetic & Reference:**
- **Vibe:** "Modern DevTool," high-performance, futuristic but clean. Heavily inspired by the "InsForge.dev" or "Linear" aesthetic.
- **Theme:** Deep Dark Mode. Background should be almost black (e.g., #0A0A0A), not pure black. Text should be varying shades of gray (Zinc/Neutral palette).
- **Typography:** Use a clean, technical sans-serif font (like Inter or Geist).
- **Accents:** Use a subtle primary accent color (e.g., Electric Blue or Violet) for main CTAs and subtle glows.

**Technical Constraints:**
- Use React (Next.js structure).
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.
- Use Lucide-React for icons.
- Use CSS Grid for layouts.

**Required Sections:**

1.  **Hero Section:**
    - Centered layout.
    - Headline: "Master Your Focus. Tracking for Serious Students."
    - Subheadline: "Pules gives you the data you need to optimize your study habits. Setup in seconds, track for hours."
    - Two Buttons: "Start Tracking" (Primary, glowing) and "Read the Docs" (Secondary, outline).
    - Background: A subtle radial gradient or "grid pattern" overlay fading into the darkness.

2.  **The "Bento Grid" Feature Section (Crucial):**
    - Create a 3x2 grid of cards.
    - Each card must have a thin, dark border (border-neutral-800) and a subtle gradient background on hover.
    - **Card 1 (Large):** "Deep Work Analytics" – Show a mock graph/chart of study hours increasing.
    - **Card 2 (Medium):** "Pomodoro Engine" – A UI mock of a timer counting down.
    - **Card 3 (Small):** "Distraction Shield" – An icon of a notification being blocked.
    - **Card 4 (Medium):** "Subject Goals" – A progress bar showing 80% completion for "Physics."

3.  **Interactive Setup Preview:**
    - A section titled "Setup in 30 Seconds."
    - A split view: Left side is a checklist (Step 1: Create Account, Step 2: Set Subjects, Step 3: Start Timer). Right side is a mock "Terminal" or "Code Block" window that looks technical and shows the setup running successfully.

4.  **Social Proof/Ticker:**
    - A scrolling marquee of university logos or user testimonials at the bottom.

**Component Style:**
- Buttons should have a slight "inner glow" or "shine" effect.
- Borders should be thin (1px) and dark gray (neutral-800).
- Use distinct spacing (gap-8 or gap-12) to make it feel airy.# studygo-landing-page
